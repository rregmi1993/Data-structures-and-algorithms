- Tree is the non linear data structure 

-----------Terms:--------------------------
Root - topmost element of the tree
Edge - link between the any two nodes
Leaf : nodes with no (child node) children 
Ancestor : parent, grant parent, great grant parent, ....... so on
Height of node : length of the path from the node to the deepest node
Depth of the node : Length of the path from root to the node
Height of Tree : length of the path from the root node to the deepest node
Depth of the Tree : Length of the path from root to the node
Predecessor : Predecessor of a node is the immediate previous node in inorder traversal of a binary tree 
Successor : Successorof a node is the immediate next node in inorder traversal of a binary tree
