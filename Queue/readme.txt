Basic Operation in Queue:
1. enqueue() : Insert the element in queue
2. dequeue() : remove the front item from the queue
3. isEmpty() : check whether queue is empty or not
4. isFull() : check whether queue is full or not
5. peek() : get the front item from the queue without deleting from the queue 


Application:
1. CPU scheduling
2. Handling interrupts in real time systems. 
3. Synchronous data transfer e.g- pipe, RabbitMQ
