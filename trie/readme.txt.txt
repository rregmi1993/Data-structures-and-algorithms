Trie is used to store and search strings in space/time efficent way.
Every node of Trie consists of multiple branches. Each branch represents a possible character of keys. 
We need to mark the last node of every key as the end of the word node. 
A Trie node field isEndOfWord is used to distinguish the node as the end of the word node.

application of Trie:
- spelling checker uses Trie DS
- Google uses trie for auto search suggetsions
